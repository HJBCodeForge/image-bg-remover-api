# Render Port Binding Fix

## Issue
**Error:** "Port scan timeout reached, no open ports detected. Bind your service to at least one port."

## Root Cause
Render couldn't detect that your service was listening on a port. This happens when:
1. The service doesn't bind to the correct port
2. The port configuration is incorrect
3. The service takes too long to start

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. Updated render.yaml
- Simplified the start command to use uvicorn directly
- Use Render's built-in `$PORT` environment variable
- Removed custom HOST/PORT environment variables

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: bg-remover-api
    runtime: python3
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
    envVars:
      - key: ENVIRONMENT
        value: production
```

### 2. Updated main.py
- Simplified port handling to use Render's PORT directly
- Added better logging for debugging

## üîß How to Apply the Fix

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Render port binding issue"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Render:**
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Find your `bg-remover-api` service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
   - Wait for deployment to complete

3. **Monitor the deployment:**
   - Check the service logs for "Starting server" messages
   - Verify the service shows as "Live" in the dashboard
   - Test the API endpoint once deployment is complete

## üîç Verification

After redeployment, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Service status: "Live" (not "Deploy failed")
- ‚úÖ Service logs showing: "Starting server on 0.0.0.0:10000"
- ‚úÖ API accessible at: `https://your-service-name.onrender.com`

## üö® If Still Not Working

Try these additional steps:

### Option 1: Manual Service Configuration
In Render dashboard:
1. Go to your service settings
2. Update the **Start Command** to: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
3. Save and redeploy

### Option 2: Check Service Logs
1. Go to your service in Render dashboard
2. Click on "Logs" tab
3. Look for error messages during startup
4. Check if the service is binding to the correct port

### Option 3: Test Locally First
```bash
# Test the exact command Render will use
PORT=10000 uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

## üìù Key Points

- **Render automatically sets the PORT environment variable** - don't override it
- **Always bind to 0.0.0.0** (not localhost or 127.0.0.1) for cloud deployment
- **Use uvicorn directly** in the start command for better reliability
- **Check logs** if deployment fails - they usually show the exact issue

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Apply the fix and redeploy
2. Test the API endpoint once live
3. Update your frontend URLs if needed
4. Test the complete end-to-end functionality

The fix should resolve the port binding issue and get your service running correctly on Render!
