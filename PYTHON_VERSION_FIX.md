# Python Version Compatibility Fix

## Problem
The deployment was failing on Render with the error:
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement rembg==2.0.50
ERROR: No matching distribution found for rembg==2.0.50
```

This was happening because:
1. Render was using Python 3.13 or newer
2. The rembg versions 2.0.50 and below only support Python < 3.13
3. For Python 3.13+, only rembg versions 2.0.62 and above are available

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated requirements.txt
- Changed `rembg>=2.0.62` to ensure compatibility with Python 3.13+
- Added `numpy>=1.24.0` for better compatibility
- Updated `onnxruntime>=1.16.0` for latest compatibility

### 2. Enhanced rembg Import Handling
- Added comprehensive logging in `background_remover.py`
- Added robust error handling for different rembg versions
- Added graceful fallbacks for session creation

### 3. Improved Build Process
- Updated `render.yaml` to use `pip install --upgrade pip` before installing requirements
- Added `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` environment variable for better logging

### 4. Fixed Frontend Static Site Issues
- Created `.renderignore` to exclude Python files from frontend deployment
- This prevents the frontend from trying to install Python dependencies

### 5. Added Better Logging
- Added logging throughout the application for better debugging
- Added startup logs to track initialization progress

## Available rembg Versions for Python 3.13+
- 2.0.62, 2.0.63, 2.0.64, 2.0.65, 2.0.66, 2.0.67

## Testing
The fix has been committed and pushed to trigger a new deployment on Render. The deployment should now succeed with the updated requirements.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the deployment logs on Render
2. Test the API endpoints once deployment completes
3. Verify background removal functionality works correctly
