## 🎯 My Recommendation

**For your background removal API: Railway**

### Why Railway is perfect:
1. **Memory**: 8GB is 16x more than Render's 512MB
2. **No cold starts**: Your API will always be responsive
3. **Easy migration**: Same Git-based deployment as Render
4. **ML-friendly**: Designed for modern applications
5. **Cost-effective**: $5/month after free tier vs $7/month for Render's inadequate hobby tier

### Quick Migration Steps:
1. Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect GitHub and deploy your repo
3. Update frontend URLs using the provided script
4. Test and go live!

## 🚀 Alternative: Google Cloud Run

If you prefer serverless:
1. **Better for**: Variable traffic, global deployment
2. **Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on requests
3. **Cost**: Only pay for actual usage
4. **Complexity**: Slightly more complex setup

## 📝 Migration Files Created

I've created these files to help you migrate:
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- `Procfile` - Process configuration
- `update_api_urls.sh` - Script to update URLs
- `RAILWAY_MIGRATION.md` - Detailed migration guide

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Choose your platform** (I recommend Railway)
2. **Sign up and deploy**
3. **Run the URL update script**
4. **Test your API**
5. **Enjoy your working ML app!**

The memory limitation on Render is a real blocker for ML applications. Railway's 8GB free tier will solve this immediately.
