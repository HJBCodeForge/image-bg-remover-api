# Railway Deployment Guide

## Why Railway?
- **8GB RAM** - Perfect for ML models like rembg
- **Free 500 hours/month** - Very generous free tier
- **Easy deployment** - Git-based like Render
- **No cold starts** - Better performance than serverless

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Sign up for Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub (same account you used for this repo)
3. Connect your GitHub account

### 2. Deploy the API
1. Click "New Project" in Railway dashboard
2. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select `HJBCodeForge/image-bg-remover-api`
4. Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard:
- Set `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- Set `PORT=8000` (Railway auto-assigns this)

### 4. Update Frontend URLs
Once deployed, Railway will give you a URL like:
`https://your-app-name.railway.app`

Update these files:
- `demo.html` - Change API_BASE_URL
- `index.html` - Change API_BASE_URL  
- `apiindex.html` - Change API_BASE_URL  
- `api-status.html` - Change default URL

### 5. Deploy Frontend
Two options:
1. **Same Railway project**: Add static site service
2. **Separate service**: Deploy frontend to Netlify/Vercel

## Expected Performance
- **Startup time**: 30-60 seconds (much faster than Render)
- **Memory usage**: ~200-300MB (well within 8GB limit)
- **Processing time**: 2-5 seconds per image
- **Concurrent requests**: Can handle multiple simultaneous requests

## Railway vs Render Comparison

| Feature | Railway | Render |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **RAM** | 8GB | 512MB |
| **CPU** | 8 vCPU | 1 vCPU |
| **Storage** | 1GB | 1GB |
| **Free Hours** | 500/month | Unlimited |
| **Cold Starts** | Minimal | Frequent |
| **ML Support** | Excellent | Poor |
| **Deployment** | Git-based | Git-based |

## Cost After Free Tier
- **Railway**: $5/month for unlimited usage
- **Render**: $7/month for 512MB (still not enough)

## Migration Steps

### Option 1: Quick Migration (Recommended)
1. Deploy to Railway (5 minutes)
2. Update frontend URLs
3. Test functionality
4. Switch DNS/domains if needed

### Option 2: Alternative Services
If you prefer other options:
- **Google Cloud Run**: Best for serverless
- **Fly.io**: Best for global deployment
- **DigitalOcean**: Most traditional hosting

## Files Created
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- `Procfile` - Alternative process file
