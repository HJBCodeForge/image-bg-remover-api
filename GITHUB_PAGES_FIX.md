# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Issue
The GitHub Pages deployment was failing with "pages build and deployment / build (dynamic)" error because GitHub was trying to build the repository as a Jekyll site and encountering issues with Python backend files.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created GitHub Actions Workflow
- Added `.github/workflows/static.yml` for static content deployment
- This bypasses Jekyll's default build process
- Only deploys the necessary static files (HTML, docs, etc.)

### 2. Repository Configuration
- `.nojekyll` file exists (disables Jekyll processing)
- `_config.yml` configured to exclude Python files
- `.gitignore` updated for proper GitHub Pages deployment

## Next Steps

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment with static workflow"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
3. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
4. Save the settings

### 3. Monitor Deployment
- Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
- Watch for the "Deploy static content to Pages" workflow to run
- Once successful, your site will be available at: `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

### 4. Update API URLs (After Backend Deployment)
Once your backend is deployed to Render or another service:

1. Update the `API_BASE_URL` in both `demo.html` and `index.html`
2. Replace `"http://localhost:8000"` with your live API URL
3. Commit and push the changes

## Files for GitHub Pages
The following files will be served by GitHub Pages:
- `index.html` - Landing page
- `demo.html` - Background removal demo
- `api-status.html` - API connectivity checker
- `*.md` files - Documentation
- `.nojekyll` and `_config.yml` - Configuration

## Troubleshooting
If the deployment still fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
2. Ensure the repository is public (or you have GitHub Pro for private repos)
3. Verify that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
4. Make sure the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/` directory

## Testing
After successful deployment:
1. Visit your GitHub Pages URL
2. Test the landing page
3. Try the demo (will need API backend deployed first)
4. Check api-status.html for connectivity verification
